                <p>
                    In the United Kingdom (UK), demographic gaps in the
                    rate at which graduates from different backgrounds are
                    awarded the top academic outcomes (i.e., degrees
                    graded 1st or 2:1; a.k.a. <strong>the good degree rate</strong>) are
                    important measures of equity for the higher education
                    (HE) sector [1].

                <h3>Data and Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    We procured a Large, National Degree Outcome
                    dataset (<strong>LaNDO</strong>) from HESA [2]. This dataset includes
                    all first-degree students in higher education from
                    2012/13 through to 2019/20. We used the IOP‚Äôs degree
                    accreditation registers for the same time period [3] to
                    identify accredited physics degrees programmes,
                    highlighted in green in the results.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For each characteristic, we calculated the risk
                    difference Œî in the good degree rate according to:
                </p>
                <p class="maths">
                    Œî = P(G|¬¨M) - P(G|M)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Where ùê∫ is the event of obtaining a good degree and ùëÄ
                    is the event of belonging to the majority (modal) group.
                    To avoid distortions due to COVID-19, we calculated
                    results for 2019/20 separately, indicated by a *; all other
                    results are for 2012/13 to 2018/19.
                </p>
                <h4>Within Physics</h4>
                <p>
                    We calculated the weighted (by cohort
                    size) mean of risk differences across years for each
                    accredited physics programme. To ensure data
                    protection, programmes with fewer than 23 students
                    were excluded from the analysis [4].
                </p>
                <h4>Across Subjects</h4>
                <p>
                    We calculated risk difference for all
                    students on accredited physics degrees; then grouped
                    by subject code (given in brackets) [5]; science,
                    engineering, technology subject status; and at the
                    sector level. We calculate 95% confidence intervals via
                    the Newcombe score method [6].

                <p>
                    Non-enhanced degrees are degrees that typically take three
                    years to complete and result in a batchelor's level
                    qualification.

                        In line with the rest of UK HE, women are more likely to
                        gain a good degree in physics, but are disadvantaged on
                        specific programmes.

                        The award gap for non-white students in physics is
                        smaller than in the sector, but several physics
                        programmes have gaps larger than the sector average.

                    <dt class="i">Disability Status</dt>
                    <dd>
                        In contrast to the sector, physics students with a
                        disability marker are generally much less likely to
                        obtain a good degree.

                    <dd>
                        Award gaps across age categories are highly dispersed in
                        physics, with some much larger programme gaps than the
                        sector average in both directions.

                    Enhanced degrees, also known as an integrated or
                    undergraduate masters programmes are undergraduate
                    programmes that award a masters-level qualification. They
                    are typically the same as their non-enhanced equivalent, but
                    with an extra year of masters' level content.

                        For enhanced degrees, the gender gap is much smaller in
                        physics but still statistically significicant and

                        Similarly, for Ethnicity the award gaps for enhanced
                        degrees are generally smaller tha those for non-enhanced

                        For disability status, the pattern across subjects isn't
                        as clear for enhanced degrees as it is for batchelors
                        level programmes; but it still points to a gap
                        disadvantaging students with a disability marker.

                        Award gaps across age categories reimain highly
                        dispersed and of a similar size for enhanced degrees in
                        physics; but larger across all the other subject areas
                        examined.

                    For each demographic characteristic examined, we find the
                    gaps in degree outcomes to be <strong>surprisingly
                    hetergenous</strong>, with substantial gaps in both
                    directions when looking at outcomes for specific
                    institutions. Below we indicate two statistical issues that may
                    explain the observed heterogeneity within physics and
                    discrepancy between subjects.

                    Our next steps will be to generalise this analysis to more
                    characteristics and analyse the dispersion of physics degree
                    outcomes. More broadly, we are working towards building an
                    multinomial regression model that takes into account
                    intersectionality, causal inference, and the possibility of
                    over/under-dispersion.
